This is the landing page DOM manipulation assignment that takes
a static page and converts it into a dynamic page that will
automatically send you to the clicked naviagation menu item.

It is mostly JavaScript code.  I also added some ids to the section elements to identify them in the index.html and added some styles to the css/style.css to differentiate the diffent non selected and selected nav items.
